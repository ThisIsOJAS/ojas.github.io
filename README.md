# Ojas Gupta — Online Resume

This repository hosts my personal resume website, built using a minimal static setup and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.

**Live Site:** https://thisisojas.github.io

## About This Project

Instead of sharing only a PDF, I created a lightweight web version of my resume that:

- Displays my resume in full-screen for easy viewing  
- Works smoothly across desktop and mobile devices  
- Allows instant downloading of the latest resume version  

The goal was to keep the experience **simple, fast, and accessible**, while still maintaining a professional presentation.

## Tech Stack

This site is intentionally minimal:

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Google Drive** for resume file storage and updates

No frameworks, no build tools — just clean and efficient web fundamentals.

## How It Works

- The resume PDF is hosted on Google Drive  
- The website embeds the PDF using an iframe for full-page viewing  
- A floating button allows direct download of the resume  
- A fixed header provides clear identity and context

Updating the resume is simple:  
Replace the PDF in Google Drive → changes reflect immediately.

## Why I Built This

As a frontend engineer, I believe even small things should reflect good web practices:

- Clear layout  
- Responsive behavior  
- Fast load time  
- Simple user interaction  

This project is a small example of how thoughtful frontend decisions can improve usability — even for something as basic as a resume.
